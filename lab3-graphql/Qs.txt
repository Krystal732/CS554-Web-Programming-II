- mutation - addArtist - says to create empty array for albums and make sure that numOfAlbums is properly calc but shouldn't it just be 0?
- explain what Date? defined in schema as scalar
- mutation - editArtist - "should not allow someone to edit albmums array" should we throw error or just ignore it and not update
